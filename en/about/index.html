      <p>
        Established on 15 August 2021, Anand Foundation aims to provide educational and rehabilitation opportunities for children with multiple and intellectual disabilities. Special sections of society are often overlooked; however, every child has the ability to dream, the desire to live joyfully, and the determination to achieve something meaningful. With proper guidance, consistent training, and compassionate support, these children can move toward independence — and it is with this belief that the foundation was established.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operating in the Dapoli region of Ratnagiri district, the center is not limited to education alone. It continuously works toward the intellectual, physical, and social development of its students. Through parent guidance, vocational training, and rehabilitation programs, Anand Foundation strives to ensure that every student can live a life of dignity, confidence, and self-reliance.
