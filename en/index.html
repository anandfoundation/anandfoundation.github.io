    <p>
      Anand Foundation was established on 15 August 2021 with the vision of creating an educational and rehabilitation center for children with multiple and intellectual disabilities. While the organization has many objectives, its primary mission is to work towards the holistic development of differently-abled individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Special sections of society are often overlooked. Despite facing challenges, every individual strives to reach their goals. However, some members of our community require additional support — and this awareness is the inspiration behind the work of Anand Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intellectual development of children with multiple disabilities does not always happen easily. They have the desire to achieve, the enthusiasm to live joyfully, and the need to express themselves and play. Yet without proper guidance, structured support, and consistent encouragement, this becomes difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parents are a strong pillar of support for these children; however, to help them lead more independent and empowered lives, specialized education, rehabilitation, and skill training are essential. Through such training, their dreams begin to take shape and meaningful positive changes occur in their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Operating in the Dapoli region of Ratnagiri district, Anand Foundation continuously works towards the complete rehabilitation of its students. It is not merely an educational center, but a dedicated social initiative aimed at ensuring a dignified, joyful, and self-reliant life for every child.
